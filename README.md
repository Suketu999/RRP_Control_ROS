# RRP Robot Controller over ROS
Derived the Inverse Kinematics relationship between End-Effector coordinates and Joint Variables for the RRP Manipulator
Implemented a closed-loop controller on Python for controlling the joints on an RRP Arm
Coded to create a Service-Client architecture on ROS for parsing the Cartesian coordinates of the waypoints for the controller to pass through
